🛠️ Setup Accomplished:
ICP Dev Environment on Windows (via WSL):
Enabled WSL & Virtual Machine Platform
Installed Ubuntu, Node.js (via NVM), Rust, Cargo, and DFX SDK
Verified complete setup for development using dfx, node, rustc, and cargo
Ready to start building and deploying on ICP!

Special thanks to ICP HUB India and BlockseBlock for supporting this initiative and empowering developers to grow and contribute meaningfully.
